# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Use what I learned to analyze the data and understand how the variables in a dataset interact with respect to each other.

## Process
#### Review files in excel
#### Load CVS files into PostgreSQL 
#### Clean Data
#### Analyse Data
#### QA Process
#### ERD

## Results
#### I was able to answer all the questions and find meaningful results from this data Like:-

-USA then Israel and Australia have the most impact from the revenue generated so the company need to find ways to attract the other contries.

-A lot of clients spend less than 1 min in the website so the company need to find a way to keep the clients engaged

-Top selling-products in different cities and countries

## Challenges 
#### The columns that only have null values
#### Duplicate data
#### Needed to adjusting prices


## Future Goals

### To be more efficient working on similar projects spend more time on planning my process to save time

### To do more complex queries
- If I had more time, I would definitely dedicate more time to understand the data.
